### Project: TAssist

TAssist is a desktop application used for teaching assistants to track their students.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Added the ability to create, add, remove assignments as well as modifying the UI to support a good viewing platform.
  * What it does: Allows the user to create assignments with deadlines, and assign them in bulk or individually to students. As well as remove them using `unassign`, and add a calendar view to view all assignments created.
  * Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because a user can now visually see all upcoming assignments etc. which allows for easy management.
  * Highlights: This enhancement affects existing commands and commands to be added in future. As well as modified the model to store list of TimedEvents. Which was challenging to make.
